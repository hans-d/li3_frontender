# Assets Plugin for [li3](http://lithify.me)

***

> This is my second draft of an Assets plugin for Lithium PHP. The first was a great learning experiance but I've decided there are a number of things I would change.

***

This Plugin now uses the awesome [Assetic](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic) library to power many of it's features.

## Original Project

This is a branch off of my [original assets plugin ("li3_frontender")](https://github.com/joseym/li3_frontender)

Stay tuned as this project should progress fairly quickly.
